## Overall Lessons

- Following a tutorial does not equal learning. Learning is trying stuff out for yourself, and realizing that you have no idea what you're doing! (And then of course trying to figure out how to do things on your own)

- Don't just follow tutorials to build stuff: focus on learning. Learning not only allows you to build the things found in tutorials, but to go beyond them.

- Try to find learning resources before trying to learn. A good learning resource will teach you the right ways to learn a topic, and prevent you from fumbling around and getting overwhelmed during learning.

## The Past: How I Failed to Learn

Building a website is an arduous task. Two years ago in 2022 I was a fresh graduate from university. As my first solo project, I attempted to build a website using React. This starter website included a Navbar - normally a fairly simple React component. However, in trying to use a Navbar I quickly entered what many on the Internet call "Tutorial Hell". I tried following tutorial after tutorial to build my Navbar, installing many different programs whose purpose I did not understand, like React Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. After a few weeks of trying this, I ended up feeling seriously overwhelmed, and gave up building my website. In the end, I did not learn how to properly build a Navbar or how Navbars worked.

Indeed, what I failed to do in 2022 was learn how to learn. I failed to consider that there are many different ways to learn things, and that I do not have to "re-invent" the wheel when it comes to learning, ie. I don't have to learn solely on my own.

## The Present: Learning Anew

Now in 2024, I shifted my mentality slightly. Instead of simply trying to build a website, this time I wanted to learn how to build a website. This is a subtle but huge difference - my learning process changed dramatically with this mentality shift.

Since I wanted to learn how to build a website, I first tried reading how others learned to build their websites. I specifically learned a popular process for learning web development from the second post on this Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1f9s8xr/finished_my_cs_degree_and_know_nothing_about/).

Following this poster's advice, I first tried learning some Javascript, going through Mozilla's [tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps).

Then after learning some very basic Javascript I moved on to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html). I eventually realized that Typescript is really just a handy way of making sure my Javascript is easily readable and understandable, and so did not delve too deep into it.

Instead, I moved on to React. In 2022, I tried following React's Quick Start Tic-Tac-Toe guide, but did not really understand React from it. This time (in 2024), I noticed the "Thinking in React" and "Learn React" sections on the sidebar of the [React](https://react.dev/learn) page. These tutorials provided a far more beginner-friendly and in-depth explanation of how React worked, and reading these allowed me to gain a much better understanding of React.

In the [React Installation tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project), I was recommended to use a framework for React. I was not sure what a framework even was, but decided to look at Next.js, since it seemed to be the most used framework.

As it turns out, a React framework seems to be a way of easily using React - in Next.js' case, it allows a React project to be easily managed and organized. This was perfect for building a website, so I decided to follow Next.js' intro tutorials: first, the one on [React](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations), and next the tutorial on (using Next.js)[https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app].

Though I went through the tutorial on Next.js, I of course have not really learned Next.js or React. To further learn Next.js, the Next.js developers recommended [templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js).

I picked a portfolio template, since I liked the idea of having a portfolio for myself. After demoing a few portfolio templates, I settled on this one by Sirius. I have since been poking around the code for this portfolio, trying to understand how it works. I also want to make it my own, hence this blog post! I have since learned a bit about MDX and how Navbars work in practice. I hope to learn even more in the future, and make excellent web programs!

## Conclusion

I have learned far more from this mentality focused on learning rather than simply building. I have gotten much further as well; instead of fumbling about and barely being able to get a Navbar working, I am making a blog post on my own (template-based) website. Although I still don't entirely understand how the Navbar or Next.js works on this website, I am far more excited to learn web development now than I was two years ago.
