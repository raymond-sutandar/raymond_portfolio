## Starting an E-Commerce Marketplace?

I had an idea for an e-commerce marketplace website lingering in my head for about 2.5 years now. So, with a bit of Next.js experience and having made (really used a template for) a portfolio website, I thought it high time to try to build an e-commerce page.

The first problem I had to solve was how to build an e-commerce page. To this end, I first consulted Next.js' [e-commerce templates](https://vercel.com/templates?framework=next.js&type=ecommerce).

Since I'm a new developer who really just wants to learn stuff, I opted to look at e-commerce templates with free e-commerce programs. This excluded quite a few templates, including those using Shopify, Salesforce, BigCommerce, and some others. 

I first decided to try [Medusa's starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/medusa), but upon trying to run the website locally I encountered some errors. After trying and failing for several hours to resolve these problems, I decided to try another template: this time trying [Your Next Store](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/yournextstore). I couldn't get this one working locally either; I had a problem with Vercel's SpeedInsights not working. After researching this problem and not finding any solution, I gave up Your Next Store and decided to test various other Next.js templates, none of which really matched my free e-commerce requirements.

Given that Medusa was a free e-commerce service, I later tried going on Medusa's website and trying their [starters](https://medusajs.com/starters/). Many of these starters seemed interesting, but I could not get them to work locally. I always seemed to be missing some kind of file or key or string that prevented me from trying out these starters  after downloading them from GitHub.

Eventually, after spending almost an entire day trying out starter templates and failing, I decided to take a step back. As it turns out, I was trying to build the wrong thing the entire time. I was so focused on building an e-commerce website I forgot I wanted to build an e-commerce **marketplace**, which is actually a completely different thing.

## Starting an E-Commerce Markeplace (for real)

I decided to try looking for a free e-commerce marketplace template. Apparently marketplaces are generally considered premium services, so it was very arduous trying to find any sort of free marketplace template. Additionally, marketplaces are apparently far more niche than normal e-commerce pages; it was quite difficult to find a template at all.

I eventually learned about CMSs, or **Content Management Systems**. These were essentially website builders, and though I initally wanted to build a website of my own with code, I decided to try and see if a CMS could work for me.

Just like with marketplace templates, almost all CMSes charged a premium for marketplace services. Many of them costed well into the hundreds of dollars, and were far too expensive for me.

Eventually, I found Tradly. It was a kind of small, free e-commerce and marketplace CMS: the only one of its kind I could find after many hours of searching. I decided to try out its features, and was able to start a kind-of-functional marketplace website based on a template.

This was essentially what I was looking for. Although it's not the personally coded website I was thinking of, Tradly worked well for the marketplace idea I had. Therefore, after many days of research and testing, I finally settled on using the Tradly CMS for my marketplace. I'll likely go over my time with Tradly in another blog post, so I'll end this (admittedly quite long) blog post here. This has been Raymond, signing off.
