## Starting an E-Commerce Website

I had an idea for an e-commerce website lingering in my head for about 2.5 years now. So, with a bit of Next.js experience and having made (really used a template for) a portfolio website, I thought it high time to try to build my e-commerce page.

The first problem I had to solve was how to build an e-commerce page. To this end, I first consulted Next.js' [e-commerce templates](https://vercel.com/templates?framework=next.js&type=ecommerce).

Since I'm a new developer who really just wants to learn stuff, I opted to look at e-commerce templates with free e-commerce programs. This excluded quite a few templates, including those using Shopify, Salesforce, BigCommerce, and some others.
